## Hey, I'm Amrik! 👋

### I'm a full stack developer based around London.
I'm currently working at a Big 4 Bank in the UK as a Site Reliability Engineer.

When I'm not writing code for work I often like to play with the latest technologies to stay on top of my game, and if not you'll find me gaming 🎮

Feel free to look around my repositories and get to know what I'm currently learning about.
