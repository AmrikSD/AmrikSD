## 👋 Hey, I'm Amrik!

I'm currently working as a software engineer at Starling Bank!

When I'm not writing code for work I often like to play with the latest technologies to stay on top of my game, and if not you'll find me gaming 🎮

Feel free to look around my repositories and get to know what I'm currently learning about. You may find these in particular interesting
